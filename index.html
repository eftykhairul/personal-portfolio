    <h3>Studing Computer Science and Engineering and Learning Web development</h3>
    <p>Assalamualikum, I am Eftakhairul Islam. Currently studing in CSE at Brac University.My aim is to become a Software Engineer. Now, I am a 2nd year student at Brac. The reason behind learning web development is to gain some extra knowledge. Whenever, I see opportunity to gain knowledge, I go straight to that. Because I believe I can gain knowledge from anywhere, from anyone. As, I am doing Web development, lets see how far can I go. Till then keep me in your prayers. Allah Hafez </p>
